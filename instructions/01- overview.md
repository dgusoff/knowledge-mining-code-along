# Purpose

All organizations rely on information to make decisions, answer questions, and function efficiently. The problem for most organizations is not a lack of information, but the challenge of finding and extracting the information from the massive set of documents, databases, and other sources in which the information is stored.


**Azure AI Search**
Azure AI Search provides a cloud-based solution for indexing and querying a wide range of data sources, and creating comprehensive and high-scale search solutions. With Azure AI Search, you can:

* Index documents and data from a range of sources.
* Use cognitive skills to enrich index data.
* Store extracted insights in a knowledge store for analysis and integration.

By the end of this module, you'll learn how to:

* Create an Azure AI Search solution
* Develop a search application
